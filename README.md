# PoS Tagging: a comparison of different approaches

This repository contains the implementation of different PoS tagging algorithms, developed as final project
for the Natural Language Processing course, held at the University of Turin in the academic year 2024/2025.

# Description

The main aim of the project was the comparison of the Viterbi algorithm and of the Conditional random fields
for the PoS tagging problem for modern and medieval Italian language.
All steps of the pipeline were implemented, from input preprocessing to a complete error analysis.
More details can be found in the final PDF report attached.
